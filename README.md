# Make null results great again: A tutorial of equivalence testing

Workshop for the Learning and Teaching Conference 2023 at the University of Glasgow. 

In this talk, I provide an overview of equivalence testing using R. There are two worked examples where I use open data to demonstrate the limitations of traditional Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (Bem, 2011) and applying equivalence testing and the decisions that go into it (Ditta & Woodward, 2022).

# Using the files

In the Github repo, there are two key files: 

- Equivalence_testing.html - These are the rendered version of the slides which you can view via Github pages: https://bartlettje.github.io/equivalence_workshop/Equivalence_testing.html

- Equivalence_testing.qmd - This is the background Quarto file I used to create the slides and apply the analysis techniques. You can see the commented code for running the analyses and run the chunks like any R Markdown file if you're used to working with them. Providing the data downloaded from the repo are in a subfolder called Data, it should run providing you have the packages installed.
